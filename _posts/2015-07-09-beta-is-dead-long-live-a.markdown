Exciting times! The _Beta_ plan is coming to an end and now all beta users will have to choose a plan to start the 30 days free trial.

We have been in beta for more than a year and a half and there's chance that now that you have to choose a plan you realize that perhaps you want a smaller plan but have too many projects to do so.

What to do? No fret! It's really easy and you won't loose any information.

## The Transition

So you went to work like any other day, whisling a happy tune, open _SmartView_ and see something like this:

{% img /images/beta_is_over/dashboard_read_only.png %}

OMG what's this **read only thing**? Just our _friendly_ way to let you know that you need to choose a plan, please follow the _Update Account_ link to do so.

To choose a plan simply click the _Upgrade_ or _Downgrade_ button in the plan that you want to try out (you can change it later).

However, it may happen that some of the plans show a _Too many projects_ message indicating the the amount of projects that you have would not fit in that plan. 

{% img /images/beta_is_over/plans_too_small.png %}

For example, in the picture above I have five projects so the _Small_ and _Personal_ plans are too small.

Luckily there is an easy fix (yay!).

## Archiving Projects

The first solution is to _archive_ the projects that you don't need for now or are not working on them. _Archiving_ lets you keep the project stored for later usage.

{% include _go_to_settings.html %}

{% img /images/beta_is_over/how_to_archive.png %}

There you can click on the _Archive_ button and voila!

{% img /images/beta_is_over/archived_projects.png %}

Archive projects (and collaborators) do not count towards your plan limit.

Of course, you can _unarchive_ a project later, just make sure you have enough room for it otherwise you won't be able to.

## Transfering Projects

The second option is to transfer the project ownership. For example you may have started a project for the company you work for but now that a plan has to be chosen better transfer it to the actual company.

That way you remain a collaborator of the project but it does not count towards your plan.

{% include _go_to_settings.html %}

{% img /images/beta_is_over/transfer_ownership.png %}

Choose _Transfer Ownership_ to enter the email of the _SmartView_ user you want to transfer the project too.

## Deleting Projects

Last but not least, you can choose to _Delete_ a project. Perhaps you were testing, perhaps you realize that you don't need that project after all and if that is the case, and you are really really sure (I can not stress this enough) that you don't need the information you may choose to go with this option.

Please, note that all the information will be erased. 

{% include _go_to_settings.html %} 

{% img /images/beta_is_over/project_delete.png %}

Then choose _Delete_. You will be prompted to confirm and then the project will be removed.
