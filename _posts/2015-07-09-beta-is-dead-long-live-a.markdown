Exciting times! The _Beta_ plan is coming to an end and now all beta users will have to choose a plan to start the 30 days free trial.

We have been in beta for more than a year and a half and there's chance that now that you have to choose a plan you realize that perhaps you want a smaller plan but have too many projects to do so.

To do that, from the _Project Settings_ click on the _Archive_ button and voila!

## Transfering Projects

## Deleting Projects
