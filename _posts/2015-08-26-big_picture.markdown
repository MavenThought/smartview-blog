Working with groups and subgroups can be a bit confusing when trying to look at multiple releases at the same time.

Sometimes you need a higher view, luckily to do that is really easy with _SmartView_.

### Comparing releases

When using _User Story Mapping_ on a wall usually all the releases are ordered from top to bottom making easy to evaluate what has been the focus so far and were should the team focus next.

The _User Story Map_ in _SmartView_ is meant to facilitate working on one release at a time concentrating on the stories on each group.

To see all the releases together you can use the _Big Picture_ view. 

{% include _go_to_big_picture.html %}

### At a glimpse

When opening _Big Picture_ you will see a grid with releases on the left and groups and subgroups on the top.
