Working with groups and subgroups can be a bit confusing when trying to look at multiple releases at the same time.

Sometimes you need a higher view, luckily to do that is really easy with _SmartView_.

### Comparing releases

When using a _User Story Map_ on a wall the releases are ordered from top to bottom making easy to identify which _User Activities_ (Groups) and _User Tasks_ (Subgroups) have been worked on so far and which stories are planned for the future releases.

The _User Story Map_ in _SmartView_ is meant to make really easy working with one release at a time focusing on the stories for the selected _Group_.

But in many situations, looking at all the releases together can help you compare which Subgroups (User Tasks, Epics) have been really busy and which have not.

The _Big Picture_ view lets you compare all the releases together and move stories between releases making planning and reordering features a breeze.

### At a glimpse

When opening _Big Picture_ you will see a grid with releases on the left and Groups and Subgroups at the top.

You can scroll from right and left to see all your stories on each _Group_ for one release.

If you scroll up (and have some complete releases) you will see them in green.

The last release at the bottom (in blue) is the _ICE BOX_ showing all the stories cooling down until you decide when to plan for them.

### Story zoom

In the _Big Picture_ the _User Stories_ look small to be able to show several groups and releases at the same time.

If you wish to see a particular story, just _hover_ that story and you will see a small popup showing you a zoomed in version.

### Filtering

To access quickly to a particular _Group_ you can choose which _Groups_ are showing on the _Big Picture_.

To do so select the _Group_ from the top bar.

In this example we can see that only _Email_ and _Contacts_ are selected.

### Planning releases

Now that you are familiar with the _Big Picture_ view moving stories from one release to another is really easy. Please note that only works for unfinished releases.

Just drag a story from one release to the next and the story will be moved to that release.

The target _Subgroup_ will get highlighted. Of course you can move the story to another _Subgroup_ if you wish so.

Happy planning!
