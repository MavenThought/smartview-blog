    <p>Not so long ago I wrote a <a href="/2014/04/06/an-owners-journey/">post</a> about a <a href="http://smartviewapp.com">lean project management tool</a> that I have been working on for the past year and a half.</p>

<p>We are about to release the <em>open beta</em> and start collecting feedback before our official release.</p>

<p>Though you can sign up and try it out on your own, a bit of help is never amiss. Here is the first installment in a series of posts to explain the basic steps for using <em>SmartView</em>.</p>

<h2>Working with your project</h2>

<p>First of all we need a project to work with. Right now the project index will show that we have no projects. We can remedy that situation easily by creating a new one.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sv_p1/empty_index.png"  ></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use a fictitious email client application called <strong>Spamzilla</strong> to serve as an example.</p>

<p>Following the <em>create project</em> link will lead us to a form where we can enter the project name and start date.</p>

<p>Once the project is created, the <em>project index</em> shows <strong>Spamzilla</strong> as the only project so far with the progress at zero. When you have more projects you will be able to see the progress for all of them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sv_p1/project_index_zero.png"  ></p>

<h3>Setting up the <em>Story Map</em></h3>

<p>If you already have a <em>Story Map</em> that you are using with your team it is very easy to transfer all the information to <em>SmartView</em>. If you don&rsquo;t, please follow <a href="http://winnipegagilist.blogspot.ca/2012/03/how-to-create-user-story-map.html">Steve Rogalsky&rsquo;s</a> post to start (you won&rsquo;t regret it, and yes, <strong>Spamzilla</strong> is inspired by his example).</p>

<p>The <em>Story Map</em> that we have on our wall would look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/sv_p1/story_map_wall.png"  ></p>

<p>But our <em>Story Map</em> so far is empty:</p>

<p><img src="/images/sv_p1/empty_story_map.png"  ></p>

<p>However, copying over the information is straightforward.</p>

<h3>Creating <em>Groups</em> and <em>Subgroups</em></h3>

<p>In a typical <em>Story Map</em> we have <em>User Activities</em> and <em>User Tasks</em>. But in <em>SmartView</em>, these are called <em>Groups</em> and <em>Subgroups</em>, respectively.</p>

<p>For each of the <em>User Activities</em> in the <em>Story Map</em> we will create a <em>Group</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sv_p1/groups.png"  ></p>

<p>The <em>Groups</em> are represented as folders (<i class='fa fa-folder fa-2x'></i>) and the selected <em>Group</em> looks like an open folder highlighted in orange (<i class='fa fa-folder-open fa-2x orange'></i>).</p>

<p>Now for each of the <em>User Tasks</em> in the <em>Story Map</em> we will create a matching <em>Subgroup</em>. Here is the example for <em>Organize Email</em> (the first <em>User Activity</em>/<em>Group</em>).</p>

<p><img src="/images/sv_p1/subgroups.png"  ></p>

<h3>Adding <em>User Stories</em></h3>

<p>The next step is to load the stories into each <em>Group</em>. The <i class="fa fa-cog"></i> icon displays the menu for the <em>Subgroup</em> and you can choose the <i class='fa fa-plus'></i> to add a new <em>User Story</em>.</p>

<p>When you finish adding a story you can choose the <i class='fa fa-check'></i> icon to save it or the <i class='fa fa-plus'></i> icon to save it and add another. The <i class='fa fa-plus'></i> icon may come in handy as you can add multiple stories without having to go back to the menu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sv_p1/adding_stories.png"  ></p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s next?</h3>

<p>In the next post in the series we will explore how to assign releases, choose priorities and start building our backlog.</p>

<p>In the meantime feel free to take advantage of the interactive guides that come with <em>SmartView</em> to learn, in a series of steps, all the other functionalities that the application has to offer.</p>

<p>To access the <em>Guides</em> just move your mouse to the bottom left corner and click the <i class='fa fa-book'></i> icon inside the orange speech bubble.</p>
